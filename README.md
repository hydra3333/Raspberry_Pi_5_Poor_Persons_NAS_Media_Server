## Raspberry Pi 5 Poor Mans NAS / Media Server    

### Outline    
If you have a PI 5 and some old USB3 disks (with their own power) and a couple of USB3 hubs laying around,
but can't afford a NAS box or 3D printer to print one nor a SATA hat for the Pi etc, then perhaps
cobble together a NAS / Media Server with what you have.

A Pi 5 with    
- `SAMBA` for file sharing    
- `overlayfs` (inbuilt in debian) for merging folders into a virtual folder    
- `HD-IDLE` to ensure good disk spin-down times    
- 1 or 2 USB3 hubs plugged into the Pi 5    
- old USB3 disks, plugged into the USB hubs    

can serve up the folders/files across a LAN.

Say one has 8 old USB3 disks `DISK1` ... `DISK8` all plugged into the USB3 hubs,
and disk each has a single root folder containing subfolders of media to be served `ROOT1` ... `ROOT8`,
then we can    
- mount the disks individually in fstab
- create a virtual folder from all of those root folders and mount that in fstab    
- setup `SAMBA` to serve up the individual disks in read-write mode, and the virtual folder in read-only mode    
- setup HD-IDLE to ensure they all spin down properly between uses and not spin all the time    

A drawback is that if one copies new files onto the individual disks, or modifies existing files on them,
then the Pi needs to be re-booted so that overlayfs takes notice of changes. Not so good for a true NAS,
not the end of the world for a media server with infrequent updates;
one could always setup a nightly Pi reboot at 4:45 am with crontab and say "it'll be ready tomorrow" ...

### This is an outline, not a script    

#### Prepare the hardware    
First ensuring that power switch is off where the Pi's power block plugs in,    
- plug in the Pi to its power cable    
- plug the Pi into a screen with the HDMI cable (sophisticated uses had do it with SSH or VNS
- plug in the USB3 hubs into the USB3 slots in the Pi 5    
- ensure the external USB3 disks are powered off then plug them into the USB3 hubs    

In the outline below, we'll assume only 4 USB3 disks, you can add more if you like.

#### Install Raspberry Pi OS with `autologin`    
Use the Raspberry Pi Imager to put the full 64 bit image to an SD card in the usual way.    
Choose to "Edit Settings" and then the GENERAL tab.    
Set a Hostname you will recognise, eg PINAS64.    
Set a username as `pi` (if not `pi` then replace username `pi` in this outline with your chosen username) and
the password as something you will remember (you will need to enter it later during `SAMBA` setup).    
Set you locale settings and keyboard layout.    
Choose the SERVICES tab.    
Enable SSH with password authentification.    
Choose the OPTIONS tab.    
Disable telementry.    
Click SAVE.    
Click YES to apply OS customisation.    
Click YES to proceed.    

#### Boot the Raspberry Pi 5 and update system software    
Ensure the Pi 5 is powered off    
Plug the SD card into the Pi 5    
Power on each of the USB3 disks, wait 15 seconds for them to power-up and spin-up    
Power on the Pi 5    
Once the Pi has finished booting to the desktop    
- Click Start,Preferences, Raspberry Pi Configuration    
- In the Localisation Tab, Set the Locale and then character set UTF-8, Timezone, Keyboard, WiFi country, then click OK.    
- If prompted to reboot then click YES and reboot.    
- Click Start,Preferences, Raspberry Pi Configuration    
- In the System Tab, set Auto Logion ON, Splash Screen OFF    
- In the Interfaces Tab, set SSH ON, Raspberry Connect OFF, VNC ON    
- Click OK    
- If prompted to reboot then click YES and reboot.    
Once the Pi has finished booting to the desktop    
- Start a Terminal then update the system using    
```
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y full-upgrade
```
If the Pi tells you to reboot, do so.

At this point, the disks should already be auto-mounted. That's OK, well change that later to suit our needs.    

### Set the Router so this Pi has a Reserved fixed (permanent) DHCP IP Address Lease
In this outline the LAN IP Address range is 10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0 with the Pi 5 knowing itself of course on 127.0.0.1,
and the Router's IP Address lease reservation could be 10.0.0.18
If you need a different IP Address/Range, just substitute in the correct IP and Address range etc in the outline below.     

Normally the Pi will get a DHCP IP Address lease from the router, which may change over time as leases expire.    
On the Pi start a Terminal and do    
```
ifconfig
```
and notice in the `eth0` interface after `inet` is the the Pi's LAN IP address, eg 10.0.0.18
and notice after `ether` is the mac address.

Login to your router and look at the LAN connected devices, noticing the IP address and mac address matching the Pi.    
Head on to the Router's DHCP management area and allocated a Reserved fixed (permanent) IP address and apply/save it.   
Reboot the Pi, then on the Pi start a Terminal and do    
```
ifconfig
```
and notice the IP address and mac address and hope they do match the reservation you made on the router.    
If not, check what you have done on the router and fix it and reboot the Pi.    

### Ascertain the disks ID info, specifically the PARTUUID    
Start a Terminal
```
# Run the following command to get the location of the usb3disk partitions.
# note: (grep -v mmcblk0 discards any results for the SD card)
sudo blkid|grep -v mmcblk0
# List all of the usb3 disk stuff on the Raspberry Pi
sudo lsblk 
sudo lsblk -o UUID,PARTUUID,NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL,MODEL
# Run the following command to get more info on disks
sudo df
```
From each partition, look for the PARTUUID and substitute that for each of `partuuid1/partuuid3/partuuid3/partuuid4` in the outline below.    

Look for lines showing mount names, eg something like these:
```
a175d2d3-c2f6-44d4-a5fc-209363280c89 └─sda2      ntfs    3.6T /media/pi/Y-4TB           Y-4TB 
2d5599a2-aa11-4aad-9f75-7fca2078b38b └─sdb2      ntfs    4.5T /media/pi/5TB-recordings1 5TB-recordings1
```
Check which partitions contain your data and copy the exact PARTUUID strings for each partition.    

Start File Manager and navigate to the folders, something like the above, and locate the root folder for your media files and note these down alongside the correct PARTUUID. Per the above, something like:
```
a175d2d3-c2f6-44d4-a5fc-209363280c89 /media/pi/5TB-recordings1/autoTVS-mpg/converted
2d5599a2-aa11-4aad-9f75-7fca2078b38b /media/pi/Y-4TB/VRDTVSP-Converted
```

Then look on each disk to find the correct root folder name to use instead of `mp4lib1/mp4lib2/mp4lib3/mp4lib4` in the lines below,    
So, these example lines     
```
/mnt/shared/usb3disk1/mp4lib1
/mnt/shared/usb3disk2/mp4lib2
```
could become
```
/mnt/shared/usb3disk1/autoTVS-mpg/converted
/mnt/shared/usb3disk2/VRDTVSP-Converted
```

#### Create mount points for the disks and root folders

Start a Terminal and do (remember, substitute the real folder names for `mp4lib1/mp4lib2/mp4lib3/mp4lib4` in the lines below)    
```
# create the root for SMB/CIFS sharing
cd ~
sudo mkdir -v -m a=rwx /mnt/shared

# create the mount points for the external USB3 disks    
sudo mkdir -v -m a=rwx /mnt/shared/usb3disk1
sudo mkdir -v -m a=rwx /mnt/shared/usb3disk2
sudo mkdir -v -m a=rwx /mnt/shared/usb3disk3
sudo mkdir -v -m a=rwx /mnt/shared/usb3disk4

# create the overlayfs mount point
sudo mkdir -v -m a=rwx /mnt/shared/merged
sudo chown -R -v pi:  /mnt/shared/merged
#sudo chmod -R -v +777 /mnt/shared/merged
sudo chmod -R -v a+rwx /mnt/shared/merged

# ensure the tree has the right ownership and permissions
sudo chown -R -v pi:  /mnt/shared
#sudo chmod -R -v +777 /mnt/shared
sudo chmod -R -v a+rwx /mnt/shared
```

#### Backup and Edit `/etc/fstab`    

To make the mounts happen at boot time, we must edit `/etc/fstab`.    
Start a Terminal and run the nano editor:    

```
sudo cp -fv /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
sudo nano  /etc/fstab
```

Using the nano editor, change fstab and add the following entries which must be in the specific order below ...    
Remember to    
- substitute your PARTUUID id's for `partuuid1/partuuid3/partuuid3/partuuid4`    
- substitute your root folder names for `mp4lib1/mp4lib2/mp4lib3/mp4lib4`    
```
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/109413/how-do-i-use-overlayfs/1348932#1348932
# To set order/dependency of mounts in fstab file, we will declare systemd option "require" using syntax: x-systemd.require. 
# Argument for this option is mount point of the mount which should be successfully mounted before given mount.
#
# Mount each usb3 disk partition, each subsequent mount depending on the prior mount.
# Careful: "nofail" will cause the process to continue with no errors (avoiding a boot hand when a disk does not mount)
#          however the subsequently dependent mounts will fails as will the overlayfs mount
#             ... but at least we have booted, not halting boot with a failed fstab entry, and can fix that !
PARTUUID=partuuid1 /mnt/shared/usb3disk1 ntfs defaults,auto,nofail,users,rw,exec,umask=000,dmask=000,fmask=000,uid=pi,gid=pi,noatime,nodiratime,x-systemd.device-timeout=60 0 0
PARTUUID=partuuid2 /mnt/shared/usb3disk2 ntfs x-systemd.requires=/mnt/shared/usb3disk1,defaults,auto,nofail,users,rw,exec,umask=000,dmask=000,fmask=000,uid=pi,gid=pi,noatime,nodiratime,x-systemd.device-timeout=60 0 0

PARTUUID=partuuid4 /mnt/shared/usb3disk4 ntfs x-systemd.requires=/mnt/shared/usb3disk3,defaults,auto,nofail,users,rw,exec,umask=000,dmask=000,fmask=000,uid=pi,gid=pi,noatime,nodiratime,x-systemd.device-timeout=60 0 0

#
```
exit nano with `Control O` `Control X`.    

####  Check and Reboot to see what happens with those mounts    
Reboot the Pi 5.    
Start a Terminal
```
# Run the following command to get the location of the usb3disk partitions. grep -v mmcblk0 discards any results for the SD card. 
sudo blkid|grep -v mmcblk0
# List all of the usb3 disk stuff on the Raspberry Pi
sudo lsblk 
sudo lsblk -o UUID,PARTUUID,NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL,MODEL
# Run the following command to get more info on disks
sudo df
```
If the mounts do not match what you specified in `etc/fstab`, then something is astray !  Check what you have done above.    

Do an `ls -al` on each of the mounts and on the `/mnt/shared/merged` folder to check they are visible.    
If the files in the mounts do not match what you expect from `etc/fstab`, then something is astray !  Check what you have done above.    


#### Install and configure `SAMBA`
In a Terminal,    
```
sudo apt -y install samba samba-common-bin smbclient cifs-utils
# create the default user pi in creating the first samba user
sudo smbpasswd -a pi
# if prompted, enter the same password as the default user pi you setup earlier    
```


Edit the `SAMBA` config `/etc/samba/smb.conf`.    
```
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```
Per https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html    
Here are some global `SAMBA` settings in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`, use nano to check for and fix them    
- if they not exist, create them    
- if they are commented out, uncomment them    
- if they contain different values, comment out and create a line underneath with the correct setting

```
